A trustworthy antispam plugin for Contact Form 7. Wave goodbye to spam and keep your inbox clean!

== Description ==
Are you unsatisfied with your current antispam solution for Contact Form 7? It might be using an ineffective method to combat the specific type of bot attacks you're facing. Fortunately, I have a solution for you!
Antispam for Contact Form 7 is a simple yet highly effective plugin that protects your mailbox from bot flooding. Say goodbye to tedious configurations and captchas, which often lead to reduced conversions and inconvenience for genuine users. Our plugin utilizes a combination of on-page and off-page bot traps, along with an auto-learning mechanism powered by a statistical "Bayesian" spam filter called B8.
CF7-AntiSpam seamlessly integrates with [Flamingo](https://wordpress.org/plugins/flamingo/) and enhances its functionality. When both plugins are installed, Flamingo gains additional controls, and an extra dashboard widget is enabled.

== SETUP ==
Basic - Install and go! No configuration, keys, or registrations are required to activate the antispam protection. In this case, some protections, such as fingerprinting, language checks, and honeypots, will be enabled.
Advanced - For CF7A to properly analyze the email content using its dictionary, it needs to parse the input message field of your form. To notify the antispam to check this field, you'll need to add a "marker" to each contact form on your website. Simply add 'flamingo_message: "[your-message]"' in the additional settings panel of each contact form you want to secure. This process follows the same method used with Flamingo. While this step may seem tedious, it is required for advanced text statistical analysis. Without it, the B8 filter cannot be enabled.
GeoIP - (Optional) If you need to restrict which countries or languages can email you, you can enable this functionality. To enable GeoIP, you'll need to agree to the GeoLite2 End User License Agreement and sign up for GeoLite2 Downloadable Databases. This will provide you with the required key to download the database. For detailed instructions, please refer to the dedicated section in the cf7-antispam plugin settings.

== Extends Flamingo and turns it into a spam manager! ==
With this plugin, you can now review emails and train B8 to identify spam and legitimate messages. This feature proves useful, especially during the initial stages when some spam emails may slip through.
Already using Flamingo? Even better! Just remember to add 'flamingo_message: "[your-message]"' to the advanced settings (similar to other Flamingo labels) before activating the plugin. Alternatively, you can explore the advanced options and select "rebuild dictionary."
Upon activating CF7A, all previously collected emails will be parsed, and B8 will learn and develop its vocabulary. This pre-trained algorithm gives you a head start. How cool is that?
Additional Notes:
- A new column has been added to the right side of the Flamingo inbound page, displaying the level of spaminess for each email.
- If you unban an email on the Flamingo "inbound" page, the corresponding IP will be removed from the blacklist. However, marking an email as spam will not blacklist the IP again.
- Before activating this plugin, please make sure to mark all spam emails as spam in the Flamingo inbound section. This auto-training process will help the B8 algorithm.
- If you receive a spam message, please avoid deleting it from the "ham" section. Instead, place it in the spam section to teach B8 how to differentiate between spam and legitimate messages.

== B8 statistical "Bayesian" Filter ==
Originally created by [Gary Robinson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gary_Robinson) [b8 is a statistical "Bayesian"](https://www.linuxjournal.com/article/6467) spam filter implemented in PHP.
The filter tells you whether a text is spam or not, using statistical text analysis. What it does is: you give b8 a text and it returns a value between 0 and 1, saying it's ham when it's near 0 and saying it's spam when it's near 1. See [How does it work?](https://nasauber.de/opensource/b8/readme.html#how-does-it-work) for details about this.
To be able to distinguish spam and ham (non-spam), b8 first has to learn some spam and some ham texts. If it makes mistakes when classifying unknown texts or the result is not distinct enough, b8 can be told what the text actually is, getting better with each learned text.
This takes place on your own server without relying on third-party services.
More info: [nasauber.de](https://nasauber.de/opensource/b8/)

== Identity protection ==
To fully protect the forms, it may be necessary to enable a couple of additional controls, because bots use the public data of the website to spam on it.
- The first is user related and denies those who are not logged in the possibility of asking (sensitive) information about the user via wp-api and the protection for the xmlrpc exploit wordpress.
- The second one is the WordPress protection that will obfuscate sensitive WordPress and server data, adding some headers in order to enhance security against xss and so on.
Will be hidden the WordPress and WooCommerce version (wp_generator, woo_version), pingback (X-Pingback), server (nginx|apache|...) and php version (X-Powered-By), enabled xss protection headers (X-XSS-Protection), removes rest api link from header (but it will only continue to work if the link is not made public).

== Mailbox Protection (Multiple Send) ==
Enhance email security by enabling the "Multiple Send" feature, which prevents consecutive email submissions to the user's mailbox. This measure is effective in thwarting automated spam attempts and ensures a secure communication environment.

== Privacy Notices ==
AntiSpam for Contact Form 7 only process the ip but doesn't store any personal data, but anyway it creates a dictionary of spam and ham words in the wordpress database.
This database may contain words that are in the e-mail message, so can contain also personal data. This data can be "degenerated" that means the words that were in the e-mail might have been changed.
The purpose of this word collecting is to build a dictionary used for the spam detection.

== Installation ==
1. Upload the entire `cf7-antispam` folder to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory.
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress, you MUST have Contact Form 7 installed and enabled.
3. Setup advanced settings in Contact Form 7 in the same way you do for flamingo, but add also 'flamingo_message: "[your-message]"' - reference https://contactform7.com/save-submitted-messages-with-flamingo/
4. The configuration page for this plugin is located in the submenu "Antispam" under the Contact Form 7 menu

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

=Will I finally be 100% protected from spam?=

NO, nobody can guarantee that, and anyone who tells you that is lying. But luckily, bots are limited by the fact that they don't use a real browser and they use fairly repetitive routes which can be recognised.

=Why I need to install Flamingo to get the full AntiSpam manager functionalities?=

Contact form 7 is made this way, the main plugin is made to be extended with other modules and this has resulted in many 3rd party plugins like mine! There is already a module for handling received emails, why should I redo it? And, in this way I can focus on my plugin, I believe the "power" of cf7 is just that and I invite you to check how many other nice and free extensions there are!

=Why are there so many antispam-tests?=

Because there are so many types of bots in this way detect them all!

Phantom-based bots fail with fingerprinting but are proficient with honeypots, while bots written in python fail with honeypots but are proficient with metadata forgery!

=How spam score works=

The system used to evaluate the e-mail is a non-proportional scoring system and each test have a different score (and can be customised with the advanced settings). When the mail score is equal to or greater than 1 it is considered spam.

=What do you mean by Standard Spam Filters=

Some standard test are Elapsed time, Auto-Blacklisting, Prohibited IP/strings and, in addition, we got some advanced test like HoneyPots, HoneyForms and the browser FingerPrinting.

=*HoneyForm, or you mean Honeypot?=

No, I mean HoneyForm! This is a hidden, bogus form that bots will fill, as it is part of the page code for them and they rarely check the visibility of an element. While honeypots can be easily spotted by some bots, these forms are not because they have the same characteristics as a 'normal' form, and it is impossible to distinguish them without truly visiting the page.

This is the first time they have been used, at the moment they seem to work and be effective, but consider this an experimental feature! (ps let me know your feedback about)

=But the standard Honeypot?=

We also have honeypots, to activate them just click on a checkbox, and they will be generated automatically for each text field. The only thing you need to check in the CF7A options page is the name of the fields used that need to differ with the names used in contact form 7.

=DNSBL... What?=

After that the sender ip will be searched into *DNS-based Black-hole server* to found if that ip is delisted for spam. 10 server are already set as default, but you can add or remove as you like, there are 50 server available (list below).

=What is B8? How it works?=

B8 cuts the text to classify to pieces, extracting stuff like email addresses, links and HTML tags and of course normal words. For each such token, it calculates a single probability for a text containing it being spam, based on what the filter has learned so far. B8 is a free software form Tobias Leupold, who I thank for making it available to everyone.

=Filters=

Before processing the email

`add_filter('cf7a_message_before_processing', 'my_message_before_processing', 10, 2 );`

Before processing the email with bayesian filter

`add_filter('cf7a_before_b8', 'my_before_b8', 10, 3 );`

Add your own spam filter

`add_filter('cf7a_additional_spam_filters', 'my_additional_spam_filters', 10, 3 );`

Add some content when resending a mail (useful to add a message like "this was spammed" or the original mail date/time)

`add_filter('cf7a_before_resend_email', 'my_before_resend_email', 10, 3 );`

=DEBUG=

`define( 'CF7ANTISPAM_DEBUG', true);`

Enables **debug mode** (wp-debug has to be enabled) - verbose mode, prints email analysis results into wp-content/debug.log

`define( 'CF7ANTISPAM_DEBUG_EXTENDED', true);`

Enable **extended debug mode** ("CF7ANTISPAM_DEBUG" has to be enabled) - disable autoban, enable advanced logging, when you uninstall the plugin, the word database, blacklist and options are not deleted.
